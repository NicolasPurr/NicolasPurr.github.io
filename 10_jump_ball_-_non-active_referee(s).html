        Even so, from time to time we still witness obvious violations or administrating error(s) that are not officiated properly. 
        A possible reason is that the non-active referee(s) is not ready to react to any illegal actions by the players or administrating 
        errors by their partner. The active mind-set is the key for appropriate coverage. The non-active referee(s) should remind 
        themselves (self talking) to identify illegal actions and the proper procedures that follow in case they take place."
