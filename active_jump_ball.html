        Jump-ball situations are exciting, but unfortunately sometimes the administrating referee is unable to toss the ball properly.
        Analysis indicates that 50% of the violations during the jump-ball are caused by a poor toss by the referee. 
        In other words, they could have been avoided. Tossing the ball is something that needs to be trained on a regular basis, 
        unlike what is currently the case. It is crucial to understand that the jumpers are tense and will react easily on any 
        movement caused by the referee. So therefore it is crucial to avoid any unnecessary movements.

        A checklist for a successful ball toss:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
        <li>
          <strong>Players are tense - avoid any extra movements 
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>s="text-blue-500 underline">Refereeing the Defence</a> for more details.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Active Mind-set:</strong> Maintain a view of as many players as possible in the play.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>45° & Open Angle:</strong> Know when the play has ended so you can transition to the next phase.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stay with the Play until it is over:</strong> Do not release focus before the play concludes.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-4">
        The failure to adhere to these principles is the primary reason for many incorrect decisions on the floor. Consistently maintaining proper coverage improves the overall quality of officiating.
