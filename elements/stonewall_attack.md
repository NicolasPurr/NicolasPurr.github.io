The Stonewall Attack is a chess opening characterized by White playing pawns to d4 and e3, bishop to d3, knight to d2, and then completing the Stonewall structure by playing pawns to c3 and f4. This set-up is usually achieved by a 1.d4 move order but transposition is also possible via Bird's Opening, 1.f4.
