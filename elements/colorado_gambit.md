# Colorado Gambit

![Colorado Gambit](https://www.thechesswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Colorado-Gambit.jpg)

The Nimzowitsch Defence (named after Aron Nimzowitsch) is a somewhat uncommon chess opening characterised by the moves:

1. e4 Nc6
This opening is an example of a hypermodern opening in which Black invites White to occupy the centre of the board at an early stage with pawns.
