Visual Basic (VB), sometimes referred to as Classic Visual Basic, is a third-generation programming language based on BASIC, as well as an associated integrated development environment (IDE). Visual Basic was developed by Microsoft for Windows, and is known for supporting rapid application development (RAD) of graphical user interface (GUI) applications, event-driven programming, and both consumption and development of 
components via the Component Object Model (COM) technology.
