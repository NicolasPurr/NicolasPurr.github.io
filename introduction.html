        Individual Officiating Techniques (IOT) is the most important foundation for either 2 Person Officiating (2PO) or 3 Person Officiating (3PO). It is evident that in the past 15 years there has been a heavy focus on 3PO (namely for the mechanical movements of the referees on the floor). This has led to a lack of knowledge in how to actually referee individual play phases in the game – this being the fundamental skills that referees need to possess in order to process and facilitate the correct decision.

      <p class="mt-4">
        These are inherent skills of IOT and are similarly relevant to both 2PO and 3PO. In analysing play phases and calling the game, some basic principles are necessary to follow:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
        <li>Have proper distance from the play – keeping an open angle and remaining stationary. Do not move too close to the play and narrow your field of vision.</li>
        <li>Distance &amp; Stationary – the priority is to focus on the illegality of the defensive player while keeping the offensive ball handler in view.</li>
        <li>Referee the defence – always look for illegal actions to call.</li>
        <li>Active mind-set – have as many players as possible in your field of vision.</li>
        <li>45° and Open angle – know when the play has ended so you can move to the next play mentally/physically.</li>
        <li>Stay with the play until it is over.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-4">
        The lack of adhering to the above mentioned principles is the main reason for wrong decisions on the floor. When referees have proper primary coverage for all obvious plays, the quality of officiating increases significantly. These obvious plays, if missed, shape what is considered acceptable officiating.
