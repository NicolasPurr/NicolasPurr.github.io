        Individual Officiating Techniques (IOT) is the most important foundation for either 2 Person Officiating (2PO) or 3 Person Officiating (3PO). Over the past 15 years, there has been a heavy focus on 3PO (namely for the mechanical movements of the referees on the floor), which has led to a lack of knowledge in how to referee individual play phases.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        These inherent skills of IOT are equally relevant for both 2PO and 3PO. In analysing play phases and calling the game, some basic principles are necessary:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
        <li>
          <strong>Distance & Stationary:</strong> Have proper distance from the play(See also our <a href="distance_stationary.html" class="text-blue-500 underline">Distance &amp; Stationary</a> chapter.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Referee the Defence:</strong> Focus on illegal actions by the defensive player. (Refer to <a href="refereeing_defence.html" class="text-blue-500 underline">Refereeing the Defence</a> for more details.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Active Mind-set:</strong> Maintain a view of as many players as possible in the play.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>45° & Open Angle:</strong> Know when the play has ended so you can transition to the next phase.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stay with the Play until it is over:</strong> Do not release focus before the play concludes.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-4">
        The failure to adhere to these principles is the primary reason for many incorrect decisions on the floor. Consistently maintaining proper coverage improves the overall quality of officiating.
